# This repository

This repository serves the sole purpose of holding metadata for eaglecord. Currently, this is limited to bot tags.

You can submit your own bot tag by the classic procedure of forking, changing and making a pull request. Please discuss larger changes in the #town-hall channel first, 
such as a tag restructure, drastically changing an existing tag or adding multiple new tags.
