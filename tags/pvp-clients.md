**Lunar, Badlion, PvPLounge and many others "pvp clients"**

Those "clients" are illegal software and care literally nothing about you. Don't use them.

Let us start with saying they aren't even clients: they are mods, they even say so in their legal documents.
Mods, more specific the monetization of mods, fall under restrictions according to Minecraft EULA and ToS.
One of those restrictions is the "no cape" rule, which is found in the section "Servers and Hosting" in the EULA:

> Therefore, if you comply with and follow the Brand and Asset Usage Guidelines and Naming Guidelines above, YOU MAY sell cosmetic entitlements, except for "Capes," which we define as anything that attempts to visually emulate the feature of a Minecraft player Cape.

From OptiFine straight up selling capes to Lunar, Badlion et al. selling Wings, which looks a lot like and has the same features as a Minecraft player Cape... here's undeniable proof they violate the Terms of Service. 
And Mojang hasn't really expressed their agreement, either - in fact, there are several unofficial messages from Mojang Studios members stating those softwares do violate the EULA and ToS.

Mojang is not in a position to take, say, OptiFine down. Even though they would be legally right, they couldn't take the community backlash, even though OptiFine doesn't actually optimize any more in the first place.
