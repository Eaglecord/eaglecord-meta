**1.16+ 99.99997% Iron Farm Trouble Shooting:**

Doesn't spawn anything at all:
 - The villagers need to sleep at least once before it will start working
 - The villagers must be scared of the zombie - do they sleep at night? or do they wake up immediately again? Check the zombie's position and where exactly your soul sand is placed.
 - There should not be more than four air blocks between the beds and the killing chamber: preferably less.
 - What blocks did you use for the spawning chamber floor? there need to be 25 solid blocks in the center surrounded by a row of glass or leaves.
 
Worked for a while, but stopped now:
 - Did the Zombie despawn or die?
 - Are there any iron golems within 16 blocks of any villager in the farm?
 - Is the farm too close to other villagers - at least six blocks distance from any farm villager to a non-farm villager are required

Golems getting stuck in the wall:
 - Make sure the spawning chamber floor is laid out correctly.

- Did you name your zombie "Sub to EagleEye"?

If nothing of that works:
please explain as detailed as possible and add a bunch of screenshots
