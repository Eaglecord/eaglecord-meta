**Eaglecord Speedrunning Tournament Rules**

**1.** All runs, unless otherwise specified, are to be held in Java Edition 1.16.1. Mod and resource pack rules are specified below.
**2.** All runs, unless otherwise specified, follow scout-and-route rules: You are assigned a seed and category, then you have 15 minutes to scout the seed in any game mode by any means within the game. Using external tools is not allowed. After that, you have to load the seed in a separate world and run.
**3.** All runs must be done while streaming to discord.
**4.** You must not use any datapacks, resource packs or mods not listed as allowed.
**5.** Timing is done using IGT. Resetting or excessive pausing will cause us to switch your timing to RTA.

**Datapack Rules**

Zefyro's timer datapack is allowed. Any datapack required by the category is also allowed - all other datapacks are banned.

**Mod Rules**

Optifine is banned *in all scenarios*. Sodium, Lithium, Phosphor, Krypton, Starlight, LazyDFU and Voyager are allowed - though Voyager should not be needed. Phosphor and Starlight are incompatible. *All other mods are banned, including Fabric API*.

**Resource Pack rules**

Resource packs with the effect of increasing visibility are banned. This includes transparent GUIs, smaller/hollow explosion particles and similar. Resource packs with an adverse effect on visibility (dark GUI) or no effect are allowed. In case of doubt, ask an administrator.
