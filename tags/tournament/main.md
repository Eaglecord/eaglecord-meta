**Eaglecord Speedrun Tournament**

We will be holding a tournament by the Roulette of Doom rules - a detailed explanation is found in `/tag tournament-rules`.

Summa summarum, you will be competing in a best-of-three duel by three randomly chosen categories. The first two will be meme categories (`/tag tournament-modes`), if needed, any% in any version from 1.14 to 1.17 will serve as tiebreaker. We use in-game-time unless specified otherwise.

Sign up by messaging or pinging either ExaInsanity#1870 or Zefyro#2750!

Runs are held between 16:00 UTC and 19:30 UTC, please only sign up if you have time throughout the week.
