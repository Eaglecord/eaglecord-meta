**Shaky-Sand 'Not Working' Checklist**

Are you playing the correct version? Shaky-sand only works in 1.13, 1.14 and 1.15 (all java)... it won't fast grow in the current 1.16 snapshots. The Boat version only works in 1.14. If you are playing the correct version, what is going wrong;

1) Sand 'Shakes', crops not growing (but also not popping off) - if bamboo is not growing, add light near by. If light didn't help or if it is the sugar cane or cactus that is not growing this is 100% a mod. If you are or know the admin, you should be able to disable that mod. If you don't have any plugins or mods, that means your server has the mods loaded by default :(

2) Sand 'Shakes' but crops are popping off - double check the sand looks the same as it does in the video... odds are your timings are off... double check the clock (and share screenshots of the clock for help if needed). If it is the bamboo only, make sure you grew it one stage (so it looks like a stick and not a pyramid)

3) Everything was working but it broke - these farms are not unload safe, meaning you need to turn them off before you leave the area and unload it (or log off)
3b) But it broke while I was still pretty close, only ~30 blocks away - most likely you are playing with plugins, some of which 'skip ticks' to optimize, but if it skips the wrong tick this machine will break... you need to stand closer and turn if off when you walk away

4) It broke when I turned it off - check the pinned comment in the video you watched... you are most likely missing repeaters coming out of the observer clock
