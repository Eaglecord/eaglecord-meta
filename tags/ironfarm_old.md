**1.16 Old Iron Farm Trouble Shooting:**

- the Villagers need to sleep at least once before it will start working
- the Villagers must be scared of the zombies (they should be running around often and occasionally sleep for a tick or two at night before getting woke up)
- there should be FOUR air blocks between the beds and the floor of the killing chamber (Stone -> Bed -> Air -> Air -> Air -> Air -> Floor of killing chamber)

Started working but stopped...
- make sure an Iron golem hasn't escaped ... they won't spawn a new one until the old one dies
- and solid blocks (like stone) under the beds... and replace the glass surrounding the villagers with stone and put a bottom half slab on that stone

Still not working:
please be as detailed as possible... and add some screenshots or a short video
