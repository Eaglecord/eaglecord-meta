**0-tick 'Not Working' Checklist**
*Note: This is for Java Edition*

Are you playing the correct version? All 0 tick only works in 1.15 or before (20w11a snapshot of 1.16 to be specific)
Kelp - 20w06a to 20w11a
Sugarcane and Cactus - 1.13+ 
If you are playing on the correct version, what is going wrong;

1) Piston freezing or slow (which usually breaks the crop)
- Building it in chunk borders sometimes causes problems, this is one of them, use F3+G to toggle chunk borders.
- Please also check it is built the same as the one in the video

2) Pistons work fine but crops still break
- Most servers has plugins that block 0 tick, sometimes by breaking thems
- Chunk borders could be the reason again
- Also check if it is the same as the video

3) Pistons working but crop does not grow
- If you are on multiplayer then probably due to plugins, paper server does this on default, you can turn it off if you have access to the server files
- lack of sufficient light levels, just put some torches around it and try again
- Wrong version (check the top)

4) Works fine but breaks after a while
- Multiplayer servers delays redstone when theres lag for better performance, unless it is a vanilla server (if you are not sure then it probably isn't)
- Built on chunk borders, this sometimes does not affect the machine but sometimes do, when you unload it (leave the area)
