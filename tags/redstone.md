(...) hardly anyone in here thinks at all. Channels like Shulkercraft have irreparably lowered the entry bar into redstone, and while they are convenient, nobody really thinks what is that these channels abstract away from the player. The rise of terrible redstone channels is a symptom of this (this is an attack or an argument against it), as is people's inability to properly design redstone.

Whenever people here have a problem that grows outside of the logical scope of "place seven blocks according to four instructions", they just lie down and cry, because it is not a problem that can be solved linearly. Nobody ever realizes that Shulkercraft et al hide the reality of redstone and logic, nobody stops to think that for large-aim problems, small-scope convenience utilities are not the solution, and that the underlying logic should be leveraged directly. Nobody seems to know how to properly work with given tools, how to modify and adapt tech to fit the situation, nobody really figures what a farm really is, or how to make one yourself.

Another symptom of this is that when faced with "this redstone machine is slow", everyone just goes "make more of them lmao" and other forms of "throw more resources at it lmao". I am yet to see anyone try to diagnose the cause of such a problem, or even perform basic application of the scientific method to come up with a solution. Instead, everyone looks to others (me especially) for ready solutions, without ever thinking whether what I suggest is the right tool for their usecase.
