**Redstone and Bukkit do not go well together.**

Bukkit and its various forks, including but not limited to Spigot, Paper, Tuinity, Purpur, Yatopia, ..., are intended to work as faster versions of Vanilla.
Not only do they break the Minecraft EULA, Terms of Service and various copyright laws on multiple levels and occasions, but they also have a strange concept of optimization: to make the game run faster, you need to remove features entirely instead of improving the code, see https://gist.github.com/ExaInsanity/99de24abdddccda47bdaa66e01eb7b0a.

 All they are achieving is running at comparable performance levels to vanilla, exposing a terrible plugin API that looks like a joke to fabric and break redstone to irrecoverable levels. Why would anyone use them?

If you are using any bukkit fork, it's time to use vanilla or fabric instead.
If the server you play on uses any bukkit fork, it's time to either convince the owner to use a good server software or switch to a different server.
